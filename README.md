# 🌌 Fractal Visualizer: Math and Art Project

This project is a simple visualizer built using **Python** and fundamental **Mathematics/Physics** principles to generate fractal images on the complex number plane.

## 🎯 Project Goal and Key Learnings

This application was developed to help a beginner programmer/math enthusiast grasp the following core concepts:

* **Complex Numbers and Mapping:** Transforming pixel coordinates (x, y) into the complex plane's fixed/starting values.
* **Iteration Formulas:** Understanding the complex structures created by the iterative application of a simple mathematical rule (e.g., $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$).
* **Fractal Types:** Drawing the Mandelbrot Set, Julia Sets, and generalized $z^n + c$ fractals.
* **Data Visualization:** Using color maps (`Matplotlib`) to render the calculation results (`NumPy` arrays) into aesthetic visuals and achieving high-resolution output.
* **Version Control:** Gaining practical experience with Git and GitHub to track and save project progress.

## 🖼️ Project Output Example

*(Place your high-resolution fractal image here. You can upload it to your GitHub repository and link to it using this format: `![Mandelbrot Fractal Image](images/mandelbrot_zoom.png)`)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Mathematical Operations:** NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
Running the Code
To run the project and generate the fractal image (mandelbrot_ilk_cizim.png), execute the following command:
```bash
python mandelbrot_cizici.py
